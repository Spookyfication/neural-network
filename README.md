# Neural-Network
A simple neural network that detects digits and letters in a 7x7 matrix

The network is started by the class 'Start7x7' and is learning 1000 times under supervision with a randomly selected value. While learning it checks wether the value has been right and saves the results with the Digital-Memory-and-Amnesia-Function and then learns with the Delta-Learning-Rule.

The program is a very basic neuronal network with 49 input nodes and 12 output nodes (0-9 + A + B) to understand the basic mathematic functions and the matrix calculations behind a neuronal network.
